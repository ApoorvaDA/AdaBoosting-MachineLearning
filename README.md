# AdaBoosting-MachineLearning

Adaptive Boosting is a framework that shows us how to:
- Generate multiple weak hypothesis from a given weak learning algorithm.
- Compute more powerful algorithm from these hypothesis

There are many extensions of AdaBoosting. Through this project we tried to implement Binary AdaBoosting(Standard) and Real AdaBoosting.
